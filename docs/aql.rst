AQL
----

**ArangoDB Query Language (AQL)** is used to read and write data. It is similar
to SQL for relational databases, but without the support for data definition
operations such as creating or deleting :doc:`databases <database>`,
:doc:`collections <collection>` or :doc:`indexes <indexes>`. For more
information, refer to `ArangoDB manual`_.
